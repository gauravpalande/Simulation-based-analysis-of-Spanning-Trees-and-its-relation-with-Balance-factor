# Simulation-based-analysis-of-Spanning-Trees-and-its-relation-with-Balance-factor

● Role: 
Network Simulator-2 Developer

● Description:
This project illustrates the simulation of packet routing mechanism implemented through spanning trees and balanced spanning trees. There is an emphasis on how the message is passed to every node in the tree and what are the advantages of using spanning trees. The two types of spanning trees, such as Asymptotically Balanced Spanning Tree and Greedy spanning tree.
   Using the spanning tree in network graph topology has a significant improvement on its broadcasting and networking ability. Star graph’s superiority over the hypercube has been demonstrated through the project. Broadcasting issues such as broadcast storm can occur when routing mechanisms are absent.
   Through simulation in Cisco packet tracer, the relevant topologies have been assessed. The mechanism for routing has been analyzed and implemented to create the topologies. An attempt has been made to create the Balanced spanning trees for the topologies. 
   Assessment of the network has been conducted using ICMP packet transfer rates across individual nodes.
